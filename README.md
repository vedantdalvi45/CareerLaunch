A robust, scalable backend for a modern job and internship finder platform.

## Overview

CareerLaunch is a complete Spring Boot application that provides a secure, role-based REST API for a job board. It connects three key user types: **Applicants** looking for jobs, **Recruiters** posting jobs, and **Admins** moderating the platform. It's built on a clean, decoupled architecture using Spring Security for authentication and MongoDB for a flexible, scalable database.

## Key Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Three distinct roles (`ROLE_APPLICANT`, `ROLE_RECRUITER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`) with granular permissions
* **Secure Authentication:** End-to-end authentication and authorization using Spring Security and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
* **Auto-Login on Register:** Users are automatically authenticated and given a token upon successful registration
* **Full Job Lifecycle:** Recruiters can perform full CRUD operations on job postings
* **Application Tracking:** Applicants can apply for jobs and track the status of their applications
* **Recruiter Dashboard:** Recruiters can view all applicants for their jobs and update application statuses
* **Admin Moderation:** Admins have global permissions to manage users and moderate content
* **Scalable Database:** Uses MongoDB as a NoSQL database, perfect for handling diverse and large-scale data

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Tech Stack

* **Java 17+**
* **Spring Boot 3.x**
* **Spring Security 6.x:** For JWT-based authentication and method-level security (`@PreAuthorize`)
* **Spring Data MongoDB:** For repository and database interaction
* **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud-hosted NoSQL database
* **Lombok:** To reduce boilerplate code
* **Maven:** For dependency management
* **jjwt:** Java library for creating and validating JSON Web Tokens

### Architecture

The application follows a standard **3-Layer Architecture** for a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Controller Layer**
   - Handles all incoming HTTP requests
   - Validates request bodies using DTOs
   - Maps requests to the appropriate service methods
   - Serializes service responses to JSON

2. **Service Layer**
   - Contains all business logic
   - Coordinates between repositories
   - Handles data validation, manipulation, and transformations
   - Throws business-specific exceptions
   - Manages authentication logic (`AuthService`)

3. **Repository Layer**
   - Defines interfaces that extend Spring Data's `MongoRepository`
   - Handles all database query logic

## Configuration

To run the project locally, you must provide configuration in `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yml
server:
  port: 8080

spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/careerlaunch?retryWrites=true&w=majority

app:
  jwt:
    # This MUST be kept secret. 
    # Generate a secure 64-byte, Base64-encoded secret.
    secret: bXluYW1laXNqYW1lc2JvbmRiYW5kaWFtYnJpdGlzaHNweWFuZGlsaWtlYmFzZWJhbGxzYW5kcGFzc3dvcmRpc3Bhc3N3b3Jk
 
    # Token expiration time in milliseconds (86400000 = 24 hours)
    expiration-ms: 86400000
```

## API Documentation

All requests and responses are in JSON format. A successful authentication (login/register) returns a JWT token which must be included in the header for all secured endpoints:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```
